## Megaguide of HTML & PHP

### HTML tags

- Called in french: balises

- `label=` : data to be displayed
- `value=` : data to be sent to the server

#### Select tag

We use the following open/closing tags `<select name=a_name id=an_id>` `</select>` with options in between

then we have the possibility to do `optgroup` to create a new group with the following structure

Important! The presence of the `selected` attribute is sufficient to be selected like in the following example:\

`<option value="caralho" selected>caralho</option>`

Any following ocurrences of options with the `selected` attribute will be ignored.
